# Embedded Animations in Beamer

This LaTeX file demonstrates the usage of embedded animations in a Beamer presentation. The primary purpose of this presentation is to explain the concept of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) using LaTeX's Beamer class.

## File Description

- **Embedded_animations_in_Beamer.tex**: This LaTeX file contains a presentation built with the Beamer class. It includes explanations, comparisons, and visualizations related to Dynamic Time Warping.
- **Animations**: The file utilizes the `animate` package in LaTeX to incorporate animated sequences in the presentation slides. Ensure all animation files (e.g., GIFs) are placed in the appropriate directories and are referenced correctly in the document. The animate package allows to include JavaScript driven animations into a pdf created with LaTeX. But the animations are only supported by some pdf readers (`AcrobatReader`, `PDF-XChange`, `acroread`, and `Foxit Reader`).

## Usage

1. **Compilation**: Compile the LaTeX document using your preferred LaTeX editor or command-line tool. Ensure all necessary packages (`animate`, `amssymb`, etc.) are installed and accessible.
2. **Viewing**: Once compiled, view the resultant PDF file to observe the presentation slides and embedded animations.
   
## Overview of Presentation

The presentation comprises the following key sections:

1. **Introduction to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**: Explains the concept of DTW, its use in measuring similarity between time series sequences, and how it computes distances between matching elements.
2. **Motivation for DTW**: Highlights the significance of DTW by addressing its role in determining signal similarity and corresponding points between sequences.
3. **Comparison Between Approaches**:
   - Discusses the limitations of the "Euclidean Matching" approach and introduces the advantages of "Dynamic Time Warping."
   - Illustrates the differences graphically and through equations.

4. **Visual Representation**:
   - Includes visualizations demonstrating similarity detection and alignment using DTW.
   - Utilizes animated graphics to visualize concepts effectively.

5. **Comparison Summary**: Summarizes the distinctions between Euclidean Matching and Dynamic Time Warping, emphasizing their respective approaches and capabilities.

## Requirements

- LaTeX distribution supporting the Beamer class and required packages (e.g., `animate`, `amssymb`).
- Appropriate access to image files, animations, or external resources referenced in the document.
